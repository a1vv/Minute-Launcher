# Minute-Launcher
Open source minimal digital wellbeing launcher for android. No unneccessary bloat. Very early in development.

# Planned functionality

* Usage time displayed underneath every app
* Total usage time visible on home screen
* Swipe gestures on homescreen, different on upper and lower half of screen
* Usage alerts when opening an app that's already been used a lot
