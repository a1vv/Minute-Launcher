# Minute-Launcher
This is an open source minimal digital wellbeing launcher for Android with no unneccessary bloat and no paywalls, written with Jetpack Compose. After having tried almost all minimal launchers on the Play Store I found that none of them were really what I was looking for. This launcher is still in development, but it has all the basic functionalities and I personally use it as my daily driver. 

Current features:
- Usage statistics right on the homescreen
- No arbitrary limit on amount of favorite apps
- Six different gesture zones
  - Swipe up = open app drawer
  - Swipe down = expand notifications drawer
  - Swipe left or right on upper or lower part of screen = settable shortcuts to any apps of your choice (four in total)
- Big *pulsating* button that prompts you to put down your phone instead of opening whatever app you're trying to open
  - Pressing it instantly locks your screen without you having to press the power button.
- Countdown timer before being allowed to open an app

The idea is that by using a stripped down, minimal launcher that constantly reminds you of your phone usage and gives you opportunities to "disconnect", it might become easier to reduce the time spent scrolling mindlessly. A phone is a tool and should be used with intent and purpose. Sometimes that purpose is to get some mindless entertainment, but when it isn't it should be easy to break free.
